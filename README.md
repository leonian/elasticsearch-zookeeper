# ZooKeeper Plugin

Sonian isn't using the ZooKeeper Plugin anymore, but you might want to
look at some of the community forks that are more actively maintained:

- [https://github.com/grmblfrz/elasticsearch-zookeeper](https://github.com/grmblfrz/elasticsearch-zookeeper)
- [https://github.com/imotov/elasticsearch-zookeeper](https://github.com/imotov/elasticsearch-zookeeper)

Alternatively, you should very seriously consider using a dedicated
masters setup, as mentioned by imotov in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elasticsearch-zookeeper/vJ_Uj38Q6Ng/RiDwXC3nYS0J).
